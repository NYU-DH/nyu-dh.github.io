title: "Public Humanities Workshop Series 1: Establishing Your Online Presence"
date: 2020-11-18
location: Remote
instructors: Jojo Karlin
description:  >
  "This workshop will introduce how academics present themselves and their work online. We will examine how academic platforms, social media, and personal websites can build your public humanities profile. Building on this, we will help participants set up manageable steps for getting started and moving forward.

  This part of a three-part workshop series that will help you develop the digital skills needed to support your Public Humanities work. The workshops will help you cultivate your online presence as well as identifying strategies for engaging with audiences and communities relevant to your work. Each workshop will have two partsâ€”a one-hour group session to introduce topics and tools, followed later in the week by a drop-in session to set up practical steps for moving forward. Students may sign up for just one or two workshops, although we hope you'll be able to join us for all three!"

title: "Public Humanities Workshop Series 3: Bridging Communities with Digital Scholarship"
date: 2021-04-14
location: Remote
instructors: Jojo Karlin
description:  >
  "This workshop will help you navigate the means of connecting your communities to and through your scholarship. Presenting tools to manage resources and data, we will show you some of the services available at the library to help you connect your scholarship to a wider public.

  This part of a three-part workshop series that will help you develop the digital skills needed to support your Public Humanities work. The workshops will help you cultivate your online presence as well as identifying strategies for engaging with audiences and communities relevant to your work. Each workshop will have two partsâ€”a one-hour group session to introduce topics and tools, followed later in the week by a drop-in session to set up practical steps for moving forward. Students may sign up for just one or two workshops, although we hope you'll be able to join us for all three!"

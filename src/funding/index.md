## Seed Grants
NYU Research Technology has identified digital humanities as one of the University’s future areas of excellence. Provided in partnership with the [NYU Center for the Humanities](https://nyuhumanities.org/) and [NYU Libraries](https://library.nyu.edu), this is the second year of a multi-year granting program to identify and fund projects that can benefit the university community by creatively bridging humanistic scholarship with new forms of computation, digital publishing, and digitization.

Digital humanities scholarship takes a variety of forms, from algorithmic analysis to public scholarship; there are no restrictions in form or subject area that can be funded under this program. Additional resources may be made available for those proposing computationally intensive work utilizing NYU’s high performance computing cluster and similar [Research Technology resources](https://www.nyu.edu/research/navigating-research-technology.html). We especially welcome projects that give voice or expression to underrepresented communities; that engage with the urban fabric of the cities in which NYU has campuses; and that contribute to the emerging subfield of Global Digital Humanities.

## Fellowships

The Research Technology Faculty Advisory Board (FAB), in partnership with the Center for the Humanities and NYU Libraries, invites applications for a series of Digital Humanities Graduate Student Summer Fellowships.

Digital Humanities at NYU is made up of a heterogeneous network of scholars, teachers, staff members, and students, spread throughout the departments, schools, and global sites and campuses that make up the university. Conceiving of the network as rhizomatic in configuration, we aim at recognizing and encouraging the free flow of energy and ideas that promotes innovative links and new intersections across traditional boundaries. The Center for the Humanities aims to help promote, support, and connect work across the network through these web pages, through its grants, and through interdisciplinary events.

*A note on terminology:*

The field of scholarship currently known as the ‘Digital Humanities’ evades strict definition — as [whatisdigitalhumanities.com](https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/) wittily demonstrates. Often said to be research and teaching at the intersection of computing and the humanities, it is an area of study defined neither by the digital (which has a long history prior to computing) nor by the humanities (encompassing, as it does, scholarship in fields that exist beyond institutionally-defined ‘humanities’ departments).

Yet the term is serving as a focus for an exciting and rapidly growing body of scholarship that is broadly concerned with connections between computing and the questions, objects and/or methodologies associated with the humanities and/or humanistic inquiry. By using this term we aim to connect innovative work at NYU with a broader conversation.

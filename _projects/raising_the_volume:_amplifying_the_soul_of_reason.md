abstract: Raising the Volume is a cross-departmental initiative to transform a historically
  and culturally rich radio program on Black and Latino culture into a collaboratively
  curated collection as data. The NYU Division of Libraries and the NYU Institute
  of African American Affairs collaborated on a series of events in inviting community
  members to correct auto-generated transcripts of digital audio files of the radio
  program. In the second half of the project, we plan to collaboratively create and
  curate a dataset consisting of these transcriptions and Wikidata items and to support
  a graduate student project in the digital humanities.

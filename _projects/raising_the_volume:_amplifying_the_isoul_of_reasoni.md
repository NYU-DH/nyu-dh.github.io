abstract: Raising the Volume is a cross-departmental initiative to transform a historically
  and culturally rich radio program on Black and Latino culture into a collaboratively
  curated collection as data. The NYU Division of Libraries and the NYU Institute
  of African American Affairs collaborated on a series of events in 2020 inviting
  community members to correct auto-generated transcripts of digital audio files of
  the radio program. In the second half of the project, we plan to collaboratively
  create and curate a dataset consisting of these transcriptions and Wikidata items
  and to support a graduate student project in the digital humanities.
